            <p>Once upon a time, there was a young girl who lived with her step-mother and two step-sisters.  She was forced to do the dishes, laundry, and the cleaning around the house, all while the women berated her.  One day, the prince of the kingdom announced that a ball was being held, open to all in the kingdom -- so he can find a suitable wife.</p>

            <p>Cinderella was excited to go, and even prepared a dress to wear to the ball.  The step-sisters caught wind of it, and ripped her dress.  The three of the women left for the ball, leaving Cinderella to cry by the fountain.  Losing all hope, a Fairy Godmother appears before her, mends her dress, gives her glass slippers, and a carriage to the ball.  She's then told to be back before midnight.</p>

            <p>She arrives at the ball, and the prince is enamored.  They dance and talk, and as the clock strikes midnight, she runs back to her carriage, leaving one slipper behind.  The prince then uses that slipper to search the kingdom to find her again.  He makes it to her house, and the step sisters/mother lock Cinderella away.  Both sisters try on the slipper, but it's either too large or too small.  Cinderella breaks out, tries on the slipper, and her and the prince get married</p>
